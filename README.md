# iGW-I #

**iGW-I** is an **i**nteractive **G**round**W**ater Book and **I** stands from the level I- i.e., the starting level for a full groundwater course.
> **The development of the book is based on the **wonderful** works of the [JUPYTER Book Team](https://jupyterbook.org/intro.html)**


## The book/site in nutshell ##

The site provides an interactive JUPYTER book with contents typical of a _introductory_ groundwater course taught at higher UG level or the early PG level at universities. 

The contents/structure provided here are mostly from those developed and lectured by **Prof. Rudolf Liedl** at [TU Dresden](https://tu-dresden.de/). 

The contents are geared towards **learning through computing**. The computing part is entirely based on _Python_ programming language. Previous programming/coding experiences is not required or expected to gain from the provided contents.

The contents of the book are divided into:
1. Lecture Parts
2. Tutorial Parts
3. Self-learning tools 
4. Question bank

The _lecture_ parts are combination of **texts** and **simpler** numerical examples. Only minimum _Python_ codes are available on this part.
The _tutorial_ are mostly **numerical** examples. This aims at teaching also the basic of Python coding. The focus remains on illustrating lecture contents. _Self-learning tools_ are interactive tools that supports the lecture and tutorial components and enhances understanding. The codes of the tools can require higher knowledge in Python programming. Therefore, codes are hidden.
