# ## Groundwater as a reservoir ##
# 
# _(The contents presented in this section were re-developed principally by [Prof. Peter Dietrich](https://www.ufz.de/index.php?de=37303) and Dr. P. K. Yadav. The original contents are from Prof. Rudolf Liedl)_
#

# 
# The content of the previous section was dedicated to very fundamental properties, such as aquifer and its types, solid and liquid (water) volumes in an aquifer, a of subsurface.
# 
# In this lecture, the subsurface will be considered from the perspective as a groundwater reservoir and some key definition and parameters will be introduced.
# 
# 
# ### Groundwater and Aquifers
# 
# 
# If the subterranean water completely fills the pore space we call it groundwater. In Germany a slightly different definition is in use. There, groundwater is only the subterranean water which is not subject to other forces than gravity (see Fig. below). That means, that the water adhesively bound to the grains is not part of the groundwater. Applicable forces in groundwater are sometime locally defined. For, e.g., In **Germany** the _gravity_ is the only force acting on groundwater, whereas forces such adhesion, cohesion along with gravity are considered internationally.

# 
# The difference between the international and the German definition of groundwater is the consideration of the adhesive water. Adhesive water does not participate in water movement. The same is true for water in isolated pores or in dead-end pores. All subterranean water not participating in water movement is summarized as immobile water. In contrast, the mobile water is the subterranean water participating in water movement.

Above the domain where the pore space is completely filled with water, there can may be an area with _partial water saturation._ 
This domain is termed as **unsaturated** or **vadose** or **aeration** zone. In this zone, the subterranean water is named vadose 
or suspended water. The water content in the _unsaturated_ zone is quantified with the parameter **water saturation** **_(S)_** and can

# The volumetric share of pore, which can be occupied by mobile water, is termed effective porosity $n_e$ or flow-through porosity
# 
# $$
# n_e = \frac{V_{p, m}}{V_T}
# $$
# 
# The effective porosity is dimensionless and the pore volume $V_{p,m}$ available for mobile water as well as the total volume $V_T$ has the dimension $L^3$. Effective porosity cannot exceed total porosity, i.e. $n_e \leq n$. The difference $(n – n_e)$ is termed **specific retention** or **field capacity**. Specific retention is the volumetric share of water which is retained in the porous medium after drainage due to gravitation.  The reason for retention is the adhesive force which bounds water at the grain surfaces. Because the available grain surface in a medium depends on the grain size, the effective porosity is also different for various materials. As shown in Figure (below) clay has a high total porosity but only a low effective porosity whereas the total porosity of cobbles is not so significant different from the effective porosity of this material.

Subterranean formations can be classified by the capability to store and/or transmit groundwater under natural conditions.

Aquifers usually appear as **layers**, i.e. their lateral extent is rather large as 
compared to their vertical extent (maybe 10 – 100 km vs. 10 – 100 m). The upper aquifer 
boundary is called **aquifer top**, and the lower boundary is called **aquifer bottom**.
The vertical distance between aquifer top and aquifer bottom is called **aquifer thickness**. 
Upper and lower aquifer boundaries do not have to be horizontal and the thickness may be

# ### Pressure and pressure head
# A reason for the movement of groundwater can be (hydrostatic) pressure difference. Let us consider a vertical column containing a porous medium and water filling the voids completely (Fig. below). We can assign to the top an arbitrary reference value pL for the pressure.  Due to the load of the overlaying water column, the pressure increase if we go deeper into the column. This is the same as what we observe if we are diving in a lake. The increase of the pressure depends on the density of the fluid and the depth below the water surface. In the setup given in Fig., we have the (hydrostatic) pressure $p$ [M/L/T$^2$] as a function of the height $z$ [L] above the reference point
# 
# $$
# p(z) = p_L + \rho \cdot g \cdot (L - z)
# $$
# 
# ```{margin} Where, <br>
# $\rho$ [M/L$^2$] as the fluid density, <br> 
# $g$ the acceleration of gravity [L/T$^2$], and  <br> 
# L [L] the length of the water column

# :name: Pressure distribution in a water column.
# ```
# 
# 
# As shown in Fig., we can add two observation points, one at the bottom ($z = 0$) and the other at the top of the column $(z=L)$. The pressure difference $\Delta p$ between the observation points is    
# 
# $$
# \Delta p = p(L) - p(0) = p_L - (p_L + \rho\cdot g \cdot L) = - \rho\cdot g \cdot L
# $$
# 
# **Example:** Compare the pressure difference for an experimental setup (pipe length 50 cm) in which water and diesel are the two liquids.

# In[6]:


# solution
L_p = 50 # cm length of pipe
g = 981 # cm/s^2, accl. due to gravity


# Assume densities
rho_w = 1.0 # g/cm^3, density of water
rho_d = 0.830 # g/cm^3, density of diesel

# calculate
Dp_w = rho_w*g*L_p # g/cm.s^2, pressure difference due to water
Dp_d = rho_d*g*L_p# g/cm.s^2, pressure difference due to water
Dp_w
print("The pressure difference due to water is {0:2.2f} g/cm.s\u00b2,".format(Dp_w), 
      "and that due to diesel is {0:0.2f} g/cm.s\u00b2.".format(Dp_d), ) 


# ### Hydrostatic pressure
# 
# Mostly, pressure head is used instead of pressure when dealing with hydraulic properties or phenomena of the subsurface. The reason is that the pressure head can be easily measured with a tape whereas for a pressure measurement a more expensive manometer is necessary. The (hydrostatic) **pressure head** $\psi$ [L] is defined as 
# 
# $$
# \psi(z) = \psi_L + L - z
# $$
# 
# This expression makes it clear why we can measure the pressure head with a tape. Similar to pressure head, the hydrostatic pressure can be schematically represented as

# :name: Pressure distribution in a water column.
# ```

# ### Pressure in a Confined Aquifer
# 
# Let us now consider a _confined aquifer_ (see Fig. below). The confining bed exerts a certain pressure $p_{cb}$ on the aquifer. This pressure is compensated partly by the porous medium and partly by the groundwater (pressures $p_{pm}$ and $p_w$, respectively). Therefore, we can write the following equation
# 
# $$
# p_{cb} + p_{pm} + p_w = 0
# $$
# 
# 
# ```{image} images/L03_f_13.png
# :width: 600px
# :align: center
# :name: Pressure in a confined aquifer
# ```
# 
# We can induce a _change in the hydrostatic pressure_ $\Delta p_w$ with an injection or release of groundwater. According to the above equation we can formulate
# 
# $$
# \Delta p_{cb} + \Delta p_{pm} + \Delta p_w = 0.
# $$
# 
# The hydrostatic pressure changes do not affect the weight of the confining bed and the exerted downward pressure remains unchanged. Therefore we have 
# 
# $$
# \Delta p_{cb} = 0 \:\:\: \text{and}
# $$
# 
# $$
# \Delta p_{pm} = -\Delta p_w
# $$
# 
# This implies that an increase of hydrostatic pressure automatically results in a decrease in the pressure exerted by the porous medium. In the case of a decrease of hydrostatic the pressure exerted by the porous medium would increase. 
# The change in hydraulic pressure will have two effects with regard to water volume. First, the hydraulic pressure change $\Delta p_w$ directly leads to expansion/compression of the water and the water volume is accordingly increased/decreased. Secondly, the opposite change $\Delta p_{pm} = -\Delta p_w$ leads to compression/expansion of the porous medium as a whole (not the individual grains!). This, in turn, results in a reduced/an enlarged pore space such that the stored water volume is decreased/ increased. Both effects contribute to aquifer storage properties (see next section).  

# ### Aquifer storage properties 
# 
# _Storage properties_ of the aquifer and associated parameters can be understood by considering pressure changes. For this purpose, we consider the effect of a _change in water volume_ $\Delta V_w'$ due to a _change in hydrostatic pressure_. The _relative_ changes in water volume $\Delta V_w'/\Delta w$ [-] are proportional to change of pressure in groundwater $\Delta p_w$:
# 
# $$
# \frac{\Delta V_w'}{V_w} = \alpha_w \cdot \Delta p_w
# $$
# 
# with $\alpha_w$ as the **compressibility of water** [LT$^2$/M]. The compressibility of water is roughly $4.4 \cdot 10^{-10}$ m$^2$/N. Taking into account an incompressible behavior of the water, that means an increase in hydrostatic pressure results in an inflow of water. A decrease in hydrostatic pressure results would cause an outflow of water. The above equation can be rearranged to yield
# 
# $$
# \Delta V_w' = \alpha_w V_w \Delta p_w = \eta \alpha_w V_T \Delta p_w = \eta \alpha_w V_T \rho_w g \Delta \psi
# $$
# With $\eta$ [-] as the _total porosity_ and $\Delta \psi$ [L] as the _change in pressure head._
# 

# ### Change in total volume
# The preceding considerations dealt with a change in storage by inflow or outflow. The change was invoked by a change of pressure in groundwater $\Delta p_w$. But a change could be also invoked by the change of the pressure exerted by the porous medium on the confining layer $\Delta p_{pm}$. A change $\Delta p_{pm}$ in the pressure results in a decrease or an increase $\Delta V_T$ in total aquifer volume. Both quantities are proportional to each other via
# 
# $$
# \frac{\Delta V_T}{V_T} = - \alpha_{pm} \Delta p_{pm}
# $$
# 
# whereby the ratio is the relative change of the total volume and $\alpha_{pm}$ the compressibility of the porous medium [LT$^2$/M]. The compressibility of the porous medium is roughly $10^{-10} - 10^{-8}$ m$^2$/N for gravel,
# $10^{-9} -  10^{-7}$ m$^2$/N for sand, and $10^{-8} - 10^{-6}$ m$^2$/N for clay. Taking into account the relation between pressure and pressure head, the above equation can be rearranged to yield
# 
# $$
# \Delta V_T = -\alpha_{pm}V_T\Delta p_{pm} = \alpha_{pm}V_T\Delta p_{pw} = \alpha_{pm}V_T\rho_w g \Delta \psi
# $$
# 
# $\Delta V_T$ represents a _change in volume of the porous medium_ as a whole. It is composed of a change in volume $\Delta V_s$ of the solids and another change $\Delta V_w''$ in water volume. Because the change in volume of the solid is negligible, we can write
# 
# $$
# \Delta V_T = \Delta V_s + \Delta V_w'' \approx \Delta V_w''
# $$
# 
# If we compare the last two equations we can immediately derive
# 
# $$
# \Delta V_w'' = \alpha_{pm} V_T\rho_w g \Delta\psi
# $$
# 
# With words that means a _decrease of pressure_ in the porous medium leads to _an expansion of the porous medium_ and an associated _increase in water volume_ and enlarged pore space. An _increase in pressure_ in the porous medium would lead to a _compression_ of the porous medium and an associated _decrease_ in water volume and _reduced_ pore space.
# 
# The _total_ change $\Delta V_w$ in water volume consists of both effects caused by pressure changes $\Delta p_{pm}$ and $\Delta p_w$. Therefore we have 
# 
# $$
# \Delta V_w = \Delta V_w' + \Delta V_w''
# $$
# 
# Using the results derived before, we can express how $\Delta V_w$ depends on changes $\Delta \psi$ in pressure head
# 
# $$
# \Delta V_w = \Delta V_w' + \Delta V_w'' = \eta \alpha_w V_T \rho_w g \Delta \psi + \alpha_{pm} V_T \rho_w g \Delta \psi
# $$
# 
# The _first term_ of the sum is related to changes in hydrostatic pressure $(\Delta p_w)$ and the _second term_ to pressure changes in the porous medium $(\Delta p_{pm})$.
# 
# **Example:** The 45 m thick aquifer under the change of pressure 245 KPa compacts 0.20 m. What is the compressibility of porous media.

# In[7]:


# Available information

dP = 245 # KPa= KN/m^2, Change pressure
m = 45 # m, aquifer thickness
dm = 0.20 # m, change in aquifer thickness

print("V = A*m and dV = A * dm \n")

# Calculate
al_pm = (dm/m)/dP # m^2/KN, compressibility of porous media.

print("The compressibility of porous media in aquifer {0:0.2e} m\u00b2/KN.".format(al_pm))


# ### Specific storage
# 
# For the characterization of the storage properties of an aquifer, we use the term **specific storage** $S_s$. It is defined as the volume of water that is released from a unit aquifer volume if hydrostatic pressure head is reduced by one unit
# 
# $$
# S_s = \frac{\Delta V_w}{V_T \cdot \Delta \psi}
# $$
# 
# The dimension of _specific storage_ is 1/L. Both impacts on water volume discussed before have to be considered in order to quantify $\Delta V_w$ in the above equation
# 
# $$
# \Delta V_w = \eta \alpha_w V_T \rho_w g \Delta \psi + \alpha_{pm} V_T\rho_w g \Delta \psi
# $$
# The specific storage can therefore also be expressed as 
# 
# $$
# S_s = (\eta \alpha_w + \alpha_{pm})\rho_w g
# $$
# 
# Typical values for specific storage range from $10^{-6}$ 1/m (e.g. gravel) to $10^{-2}$ 1/m (e.g. clay).
# 

# ### Storativity 
# 
# Due to their relatively large lateral extent, aquifers are mostly considered as spatially two-dimensional (2D) systems. In this case, specific storage $S_s$ is replaced by the **storativity** or **storage coefficient** $S$ (Fig. below). Reference volume in a confined aquifer for defining specific storage $S_s$ is a unit cube (e.g. $V_T = 1$ m$^3$), and for defining storativity $S$ is a cuboid extending from the aquifer bottom to the aquifer top over a unit area (e.g. $A = 1$ m$^2$ and $V_T = A\cdot m$).
# 
# For confined aquifers $S$ is simply obtained by multiplying $S_s$ by the aquifer thickness $m$
# 
# $$
# S = S_s \cdot m
# $$
# 
# 
# ```{image} images/L03_f_14.png
# :width: 600px
# :align: center
# :name: Reference volume for defining storativity
# ```
# 
# 
# _Storativity_ can be interpreted as the volume of water released from an aquifer volume extending from the aquifer bottom up to the aquifer top over a unit area if the hydrostatic pressure is reduced by one unit. _Storativity_ is dimensionless.
# 
# Actually, **unconfined** aquifers are always treated as 2D systems. As a consequence, storativity is used to quantify water storage properties. The definition of storativity remains unchanged in principle but the considered aquifer volume now extends from the aquifer bottom up to the water table. For _unconfined aquifers_, storativity values correspond to _effective porosities_. This is explained by the free groundwater table. In this case a pressure changes simply lead to filling or emptying of voids. This is fundamentally different from the storage properties of confined aquifers discussed before.                                                                            
# 
# In **confined** aquifers all voids remain filled with groundwater during pressure changes and storage properties depend on the compressibilities of water and the porous medium.
