    "Python is an open-source interpreted, high-level, general-purpose programming language. This means:\n",
    "\n",
    "+  Interpreted/high-level language: This makes we avoid the nuances of fundamental coding as done by computer programmers/engineers. \n",
    "\n",
    "+  General purpose programming language and _Open-source_ ecosystem: This means it is extensible. Already over 200,000 Python packages are available ([Check Here](https://pypi.org/)). Also, it means being **free** of cost. \n",
    "\n",
    "+  For Groundwater: We can use Python packages such as **Numpy** (for numerical computing), **Scipy** (for scientific computing), **Sympy** (for symbolic computing), **Matplotlib** (for plotting) etc. for our computing and modelling in the course. "

    "\n",
    "Python is now over 15 years old programming language. Its development can be traced from:\n",
    "\n",
    "+ **Guido van Rossum** began developing Python in 1980 at Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica (CWI), the Netherlands. Its implementation (_Python v.1_) was released in 1994.\n",
    "\n",
    "+ _Python 2.0_, released in 2000 became one of the most used general purpose programming language. Python 2.0 is now being replaced by _Python 3.0_ (from 2020).\n",
    "\n",
    "+ _Python 3.0_ will be used in our class. It is _not_ 100% compatible with earlier versions of _Python._\n",
    "\n",
    "+ _Python_ name comes from the British comedy group Monty Python (Van Rossum enjoyed their show). The official _Python_ documentation [(Check here)](https://www.python.org/doc/) also contains various references to Monty Python routines.\n"

    "\n",
    "+ _Python_ is a common tool among engineers, experts and researchers at universities and industry.\n",
    "\n",
    "+ _Python_ is system independent, therefore it is highly portable. Beside, it is a versatile (multi-purpose) language.\n",
    "\n",
    "+ _Python_ is incredibly flexible and can be adapted to specific local needs using enormous number of **PACKAGES**. Beside, it can easily interface with other languages e.g., C++, Java.\n",
    "\n",
    "+ _Python_ is under incredibly active development, improving greatly, and supported wildly by both professional and academic developers."
