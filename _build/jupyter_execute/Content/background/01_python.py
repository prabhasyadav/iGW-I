# ## Python Programming language
# 
# ### What is it?
# 
# Python is an open-source interpreted, high-level, general-purpose programming language. This means:
# 
# +  Interpreted/high-level language: This makes we avoid the nuances of fundamental coding as done by computer programmers/engineers. 
# 
# +  General purpose programming language and _Open-source_ ecosystem: This means it is extensible. Already over 200,000 Python packages are available ([Check Here](https://pypi.org/)). Also, it means being **free** of cost. 
# 
# +  For Groundwater: We can use Python packages such as **Numpy** (for numerical computing), **Scipy** (for scientific computing), **Sympy** (for symbolic computing), **Matplotlib** (for plotting) etc. for our computing and modelling in the course. 

# ### A bit of history of Python Programming language
# 
# Python is now over 15 years old programming language. Its development can be traced from:
# 
# + **Guido van Rossum** began developing Python in 1980 at Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica (CWI), the Netherlands. Its implementation (_Python v.1_) was released in 1994.
# 
# + _Python 2.0_, released in 2000 became one of the most used general purpose programming language. Python 2.0 is now being replaced by _Python 3.0_ (from 2020).
# 
# + _Python 3.0_ will be used in our class. It is _not_ 100% compatible with earlier versions of _Python._
# 
# + _Python_ name comes from the British comedy group Monty Python (Van Rossum enjoyed their show). The official _Python_ documentation [(Check here)](https://www.python.org/doc/) also contains various references to Monty Python routines.
# 

# ### Why use Python Programming Language
# 
# Many reasons but to put a few points here:
# 
# + _Python_ is a common tool among engineers, experts and researchers at universities and industry.
# 
# + _Python_ is system independent, therefore it is highly portable. Beside, it is a versatile (multi-purpose) language.
# 
# + _Python_ is incredibly flexible and can be adapted to specific local needs using enormous number of **PACKAGES**. Beside, it can easily interface with other languages e.g., C++, Java.
# 
# + _Python_ is under incredibly active development, improving greatly, and supported wildly by both professional and academic developers.

# ### Python Language Popularity

# ```
# + _Python_ has become a mainstream computing language. 
# + Details of the plot are [here](shorturl.at/htwQ7). 
# + This all means - it is good to learn to code in _Python_
# 

# ### Very basics of Python Programming
# 
# _Python_ is a very extensive language. To get started we learn the very fundamentals of the language.

# 
# 
# **A FUNCTION in Python**
# 
# A _function_ in a programming provide an ability to develop a reusable code-block with an option of several operations. This means, a function have input (or a set of input) and provide an (or a set of) output.
# 
#

# ```
# 
# Semicolon (:) in line 1 and _Indentation_ after line 1 are required. **def**, **return** are _Python_ keywords. There are quite few of them.
# 

# ### How much Python Programming should we know?
# 
# This is probably the most important question. The **clear** answer at least for this course is that **no** programming has to be learned. 
# This course do not expect any pre-coding skills. This course is intended for Basic Groundwater teaching, and that is the focus.
# But, how about learning groundwater by coding?
# 
# Eventually, the depth of programming to learn is an individual choice. This course considers programming as a tool to learn better.
# 
# In this course the _codes_ can are written in a way so that it can be easily read. In addition, this interactive book will allow quite many of the _code_ to be edited and executed in the book itself. For more advanced learning the popular notebook interface **JUPYTER** is to be used. 
# 
# **JUPYTER** interface, on which interface this book is developed, is very briefly explained in the next section.
