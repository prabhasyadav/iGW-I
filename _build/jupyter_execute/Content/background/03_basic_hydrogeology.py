# ### What is Hydrogeology? ###
# 
# _**Hydrogeology**_ is the study of the laws governing the movement of subterranean water, the mechanical, chemical, and thermal interaction of this water with the porous solid, and the transport of energy and chemical constituents by the flow. 
# (Domenico and Schwartz, 1990)
# 
# 
# The dominant reliance of groundwater for the drinking globally has made hydrogeology a very important academic course. Also, it is a very important research field. Therefore, several **techniques** and **methods** are now available to explore and understand **Hydrogeological Process**. The methods and techniques can be broadly categorized to:
# 
# 1. Field works
# 2. Laboratory experiments
# 3. Computer modeling
# 
# 
# _Computer modelling_ is often the most economical method but its usefullness rely of data obtained from _Field works_ and _Laboratory experiments._ Thus, the sequence of techniques/methods to be adopted depends on the available site information.

# ### Example: Groundwater Extraction Well
# 
# Groundwater is extracted using a groundwater well applying _hydrogeological_ methods and techniques. The procedure followed can be summarized in the following steps:
# 
# 1. The appropriate extraction location is identified 
# 2. Drilling machine are used to obtain sub-surface structure, i.e. or well logs are obtained. The process is also called well logging.
# 3. Well logs are studied in detail to identify the characteristics of the subsurface- e.g., how thick is the aquifer or identify environmental consequence of water extraction.
# 4. The construction of well begins
# 
# Groundwater extraction using well is a challenge when aquifers are located very deep from the surface, e.g., in deserts.

**Wells** are placed on the layer or that aquifer part which allows feasible extraction of groundwater. 
The extraction leads to drop of groundwater level. To ensure that there is sustainable extraction,
the drops in the level has to be monitored. Quite often this is done through _computer modelling_. There
already exists several computer models that can use the well logs data (also called Borehole) and provide
good estimations of the effects due to extraction. The _computer models_ are also able to predict the effects
at larger scales, e.g., regional scales. _Computer models_ are oftenly used these days be agencies to determine
quantities such as **travel time**, **capture zones** or obtain **isochrones**, which are used for deciding on
groundwater extraction programmes.

# ### Groundwater and Global Water Cycle ###
# 
# Water bodies that exist on earth is connected, and they function as a cycle, called **Global Water Cycle**. It is estimated that over 57, 700 Km$^3$ of water actively participates in the cycle each year. **Precipitation** and **evaporation** are the two main components of the cycle in which **temperature** plays the critical role. In the cycle, **Groundwater** receives water from _precipitation,_ It then contributes to _evaporation_ through subsurface flow or through mostly human intervention (e.g., use for drinking water). 
# 
# The water cycle provides an approach to judge the sustainability of groundwater extraction. The sustainability of extraction can be obtained if extraction rate approximately equals the replenishing rate. Often the replenishing rate of groundwater is much slower and this has led to groundwater stress in many parts of the world.

# ### The Hydrological Balance ###
# 
# Since _groundwater_ is part of the global water cycle, the balance of the cycle becomes an important topic. In general:
# 
# + The _hydrological balance_ provides a relationship between various flow rates for a certain area. It is based on the conservation of water volume.
# + expressed in words:  _inflow_ equals _outflow_ plus _change in storage_
# + expressed by a formula:
# 
# $$
# P = ET + R + \Delta S
# $$
# 
# ```{margin} Where,
# where, <br>
# $P$ = _Precipitation, <br> $ET$ = Evapotranspiration, <br> $R$ = Runoff,_  and <br> $\Delta S$ = _Change in Storage_
# 
# ```
# 
# The _change in storage_ can be interpreted in the following way: 
# 
# + change in storage $\Delta S > 0$ : Water volume is increasing with time in the investigation area.
# 
# + change in storage $\Delta S < 0$:Water volume is decreasing with time in the investigation area.
# 
# + change in storage $\Delta S = 0$: Water volume does not change with time in the investigation area (steady-state or stationary situation, i.e. inflow equals outflow).

# ### Water Volume 
# 
# 
# **So how much water do we have?**<br>
# It is estimated* that the total volume of water on Earth amounts to ca. 1 358 710 150 km$^3$ ($\approx$ 1018 m$^3$).
# 
# ```{image} images/L01_f_6.png

# ```
# 
# The total volume of fresh water on Earth amounts to ca. $38\times 10^6$ km$^3$ ($\approx$ 1016 m$^3$).<br><br>
# 
# _*Gleick P. (1996): Water re-sources, in: Schneider S. H. (ed.), Encyclopedia of climate and weather 2, Oxford Univ. Press._
# 

# ### Volume of Available Fresh Water ###
# 
# **Fresh water** are water with low concentrations of dissolved salts and other total dissolved solids, i.e., sea/ocean water or brackish water are not fresh water. Human activities (drinking water) are directly dependent on fresh activities.  
# 
# **So how much _fresh water_ do we have?**
# 
# 
# It is estimated* that the total volume of available fresh water (liquid) on Earth amounts to ca. 8 831 600 km$^3$ ($\approx$ 1016 m$^3$).

# ### Volume and Mass Budget
# 
# 
# Very basics of volume and mass budget - let us start with _budget._
# 
# **Budget** = quantitative comparison of _growth_ (or _production_) and _loss_ in a system
# 
# Budgets can be put together for various quantities:
# + energy
# + mass <span style="color:blue">$\leftarrow$ needed to quantify transport of solutes in groundwater</span>
# + volume <span style="color:blue">$\leftarrow$  needed to quantify groundwater flow</span>
# + momentum
# + electric charge
# + number of inhabitants
# + animal population
# + money (bank account!)
# + and many others
# 
# In this course we focus on _Mass Budget_ and _Volume Budget._

# ### Volume Budget ###
# 
# As discussed in the last topic a _budget_ represents the change (e.g., growth and loss). Thus, it is more suitable to quantify the **volume budget** in terms of a change, representing two different states (e.g., time $(t)$). More formally, the **volume budget** ($\Delta V$) can be obtained from: 
# 
# $$
# \Delta V = Q_{in} \cdot \Delta t - Q{out} \cdot \Delta t 
# $$
# <br>
# with, <br>	
# 
# $\Delta t$ = time interval [T] <br>
# $\Delta V$ = change of volume in the system [L$^3$] <br>
# $Q_{in}$ = volumetric rate of flow into the system [L$^3$/T] <br>
# $Q_{out} =$ volumetric rate of flow out of the system [L$^3$/T] <br>
# 
# The following points have to be considered when using the above equation:
# 
# + Inflow and outflow may each consist of several individual components. <br>
# 
# + $\Delta V = 0$ (no change in  volume) is tantamount to steady-state or stationary (= time-independent) conditions. <br>
# 
# + For steady-state conditions we have: $Q_{in} = Q_{out}$
# 

# #### Water Budget for a Catchment ####
# 
# The equation provided for _volume budget_ looks simple but in practice it is very complicated as several _inflow_ and _outflow_ components must be considered. Quantifying these components can be a challenging task.
# 
# For quantifying water budget of a catchment, one has to consider the following components:
# 
# **To be considered:</span>**
# + precipitation
# + evapotranspiration
# + surface runoff
# + subsurface runoff
# 
# Among the above components, quantification of evapotranspiration and subsurface runoff have very high level of uncertainties.
#

# :align: center
# :name: Water-Budget
# ```

# ### Example: Estimation of Subsurface Runoff ###
# 
# Most numbers used in the example do not refer to the catchment shown before!
# 
# To calculate the following four-steps are to be followed:
# 
# + Step 1: determine rate of inflow in m³/a 
# + step 2: determine rate of outflow due to evapotranspiration (ET.A) in m³/a    
# + Step 3: express rate of outflow due to surface runoff in m³/a
# + step 4: determine rate of outflow due to subsurface runoff 
# 
# An Example:<br>
# For given data, determine the rate of outflow Qout,sub due to subsurface runoff for steady-state conditions

# In[4]:


A = 4500 # km², catchment area
P = 550 # mm/a, precipitation
ET = 200 # mm/a, evapotranspiration
Qout_surf = 40 # m³/s, surface runoff
Delta_V = 0 # m³, change in volume = 0 Steady-state conditions

#Volume budget in this example: P·A = ET·A + Qout,surf + Qout,sub

#Step 1    
Qin = P*A*10**3  #m³/a, 10^3 for unit conversion

#step 2: 
ET_A = ET*A*10**3 #m³/a, 10^3 for unit conversion

#Step 3: 
Qout_surf = Qout_surf *365*24*3600 #  m³/a

# step 4:
Qout_sub = Qin - ET_A - Qout_surf # m³/a 



print("The rate of inflow, Qin is {0:1.1E}".format(Qin),"m\u00b3/a \n"); print("The outflow rate due to Evapotranspiration is {0:1.1E}".format(ET_A),"m\u00b3/a \n")
print("The surface outflow rate, Q_out_surf in m\u00b3/a is {0:1.1E}".format(Qout_surf),"m\u00b3/a \n");print("The subsurface outflow rate, Qout_surf in m\u00b3/a is {0:1.1E}".format(Qout_sub),"m\u00b3/a \n")


# ### Mass Budget ###
# 
# The **mass budget** is quantified similar to the _volume budget._ Mathematically, the _mass budget_ is:
# 
# $$\Delta M = J_{in}\cdot \Delta t - J_{out} \cdot \Delta t$$ 
# 
# with <br>
# $\Delta t$ = time interval [T]<br> 
# 	$\Delta M$ = change of mass in the system [M]<br>
# 	$J_{in}$ = rate of mass flow into the system [M/T]<br>
# 	$J_{out}$ = rate of mass flow out of the system [M/T]
#  
# Similar to _volume budget,_ the following points have to be considered in quantifying mass budget:
# 
# + Inflow and outflow may each consist of several individual components.<br>
# + $\Delta M$ = 0 (no change in mass) is tantamount to steady-state or stationary <br>(= time-independent) conditions.<br>
# + For steady-state conditions we have: $J_{in}$= $J_{out}$

# ### Example of Mass Budget: Radioactive Decay ### 
# 
# Consider a decay chain comprising of the three chemicals: **A**, **B** and **C** 
# 
# + decay chain: A $\rightarrow$ B $\rightarrow$ C       <br>                                                                   
# + 30% of $\text{A}$ and 20% of $\text{B}$  decay each year.<br>
# 
# + decay rate of $\text{A}$   = production rate of $\text{B}$   = $0.3 \cdot a^{-1}\cdot M_A$ <br>
# 
# + decay rate of $\text{B}$ = production rate of $\text{C}$ = $0.2\cdot a^{-1}\cdot M_B$ <br>
# 
# + mass budgets for $\text{A}$, $\text{B}$ and $\text{C}$:<br>    
# 
# 
# 
# \begin{equation*}
# \begin{split}
# \Delta M_A &= 0.3 \text{ a $^{-1}$ } \cdot M_A  \cdot \Delta t  \\
# \Delta M_B  &= 0.3 \text{a$^{-1}$} \cdot M_A  \cdot \Delta t - 0.2 \text{ a$^{-1}$} \cdot M_B  \cdot \Delta t \\
# \Delta M_C &= 0.2 \text{a$^{-1}$} \cdot M_B  \cdot \Delta t
# \end{split}
# \end{equation*}
# 
#   	
# + Similar equations hold for quantitative descriptions of some chemical reactions which correspond to the type A $\rightarrow$ B $\rightarrow$ C

# ### Comparison of Mass and Volume Budgets ###
# 
# **mass budget**:	$\Delta M = J_{in} \cdot \Delta t - J_{out} \cdot \Delta t$
# 
# **volume budget**:	$\Delta V = Q_{in} \cdot \Delta t - Q_{out} \cdot \Delta t $
# 
# 
# + Mass and volume budgets are equivalent if there is no change of density $\rho$ [M/L$^3$] with time. In this case the well known relationship $\Delta M$ = $\rho \cdot \Delta V$ holds and each equation given above can be directly transformed into the other one.
# 
# 
# + If density changes have to be considered (e.g. for gas flow), the mass budget equation remains valid but the volume budget equation must be modified because $\Delta M = \rho \cdot \Delta V + \Delta \rho \cdot V$ with $\Delta \rho$= change in density.
# 
# 
# + Cases with changing density have proven to be more easily tractable if the mass budget equation is used.
