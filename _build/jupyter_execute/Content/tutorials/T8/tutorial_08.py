The aquifer is confined but of variable thickness, hence $T = Kb$, cannot be used. In this case we need to 
find a representative aquifer thickness. This is simple if it can be assumed that a slope decreases linearly through-out
its length. So, we can write for a representative $m$
$$
m = \frac{m_3-m_1}{L}x + m_1  \qquad\qquad \text{(eq. 2A)}
$$
where $x$ is a lengthwise distance of $m$ from $m_1$. Equation above is simply
an equation of straight line $y = ax + c$, in which slope $a = \frac{m_3-m_1}{L} $ and $c = m_1$.

Now Darcy law can be used to obtain discharge per unit width ($q'$). 

$$
q' = -mK\frac{dh}{dx} \qquad\qquad \text{(eq. 2B)}
$$

with conductivity $K$ and hydraulic head gradient $dh/dx$. We substitute $b$ from eq. (2A) to eq. (2B)
$$
q' = -\Bigg(\frac{m_3-m_1}{L}x + m_1\Bigg) \cdot K\frac{dh}{dx}  \qquad\qquad \text{(eq. 2C)}
$$

Rearranging eq. (2C) we get
$$
-dh = \frac{q'}{K}\cdot \frac{dx}{\frac{m_3 - m_1}{L}x+m_1}
\qquad\qquad \text{(eq. 2D)}
$$

Differential equation Eq. (2D) has to be solved to obtain the discharge.

Eq. (2D) is a variable separated differential equation, so direct integration can be done with the following hydraulic (boundary) conditions:
$$
\text{for } x = 0,  \; h = h_1 \qquad \text{and}\qquad \text{for } x = L, \; h = h_3
$$

i.e.,
$$
-\int_{h_1}^{h_3} dh = \frac{q'}{K}\cdot\int_0^L \frac{dx}{\frac{m_3-m_1}{L}x + m_1}
\qquad \qquad \text{eq. (2E)}$$

The integral on the right hand side of eq. (2E) is an elementary integral the solution of which is of the form:
$$
\int\frac{dx}{ax + b} = \frac{1}{a}\ln(ax+b) + C
$$
based on this, the solution of eq. (2E) will be
$$
h_1 - h_3 = \frac{q'}{K} \frac{1}{\frac{m_3-m_1}{L}}\cdot\Bigg[\ln\Bigg(\frac{m_3-m_1}{L}L + m_1 \Bigg) - \ln\Bigg(\frac{m_3-m_1}{0}0 + m_1 \Bigg)\Bigg]
$$
Simplifying which we get
$$
h_1 - h_3  = \frac{q'}{K}\cdot \frac{L}{m_3-m_1}\cdot \ln\frac{m_3}{m_1}
$$
Then, $q'$ the unit aquifer width discharge can be obtained from
$$
q' = K \frac{h_1- h_3}{L}\cdot\frac{m_3 - m_1}{\ln\frac{m_3}{m_1}}
\qquad \qquad \text{eq. (2F)}$$

# Solution of Homework Problem 9

rh9_3 = pn.pane.LaTeX(r"""

For an unconfined aquifer, the case here, the water table = hydraulic head. For a condition as in this problem the height 
of the water table $h$ as a function of position $x$ can be obtained from the following expression provided in Fetter (2014):
$$
h = \sqrt{h_1^2 - \frac{(h_1^2- h_2^2)x}{L} + \frac{w}{K}(L-x)x}
\quad\quad \text{eq. (3A)}
$$

From which discharge per unit width $(q')$ can be obtained by differentiating eq. (3A) with respect to $x$, 
and using Darcy Law $q' = -Kh (dh/dx)$ for unconfined aquifer. Fetter (2014) provides the following solution: 
$$
q'(x) = \frac{K (h_1^2 - h_2^2)}{2L}- w\Bigg(\frac{L}{2}-x\Bigg)
\quad\quad \text{eq. (3B)} $$

For the case when $w= 0$, the last term under the square root in eq. (3A) becomes 0, and then $h$ is 
$$
h = \sqrt{h_1^2 - \frac{(h_1^2- h_2^2)x}{L}}

# ### Tutorial Problem 20 ###

# A column ($L = 1$ m and $\oslash= 5$ cm) was packed with sandy soil ($n_e= 35\%$,  $K= 0.0002$ m/s). The hydraulic head at the inlet and the outlet was set to 235 m and 230 m, respectively. The NaCl solution with concentration 10 mg/L was steadily introduced to the column after saturating it with distilled water. The experiment condition was such that the diffusive flow could be neglected. 
# 
# **A.** Determine the advective mass flow and the mass flux entering the column?
# 
# **B.** What will be the concentration at the outlet of the column when only advective flow is considered? Consider the NaCl conc. = 0 at the outlet initially.
