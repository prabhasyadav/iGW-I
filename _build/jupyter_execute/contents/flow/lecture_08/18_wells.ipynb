    "## Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "In the last lecture ({doc}`/contents/flow/lecture_07/17_quantify_flow` we derived system equations for different groundwater flow problems. We realized of the difficulties associated with solving flow problems specially at higher dimensions (2D/3D). Numerical methods are mostly used for solving groundwater problems but direct (analytical) solutions are also possible for some problems. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Wells** are the most common and also most extensively used method of utilizing (or affecting) groundwater. Thus, _wells_ represent a very common groundwater problem. We can now use our understanding of aquifer properties and groundwater system equations to analyze effect of _wells_ on the natural groundwater flow. We will however restrict our extent, in this lecture, to problems that can be directly solved. After learning numerical methods (in last part of this course), we will apply it to evaluate more complex groundwater problems also associated with wells.\n",
    "\n",
    "We begin this lecture recalling groundwater storage property _transmissivity._ Introducing _wells_ we then derive few relations that can help us understand the effect of wells in groundwater flow. To conclude, we will use the _wells_ to characterize aquifers, i.e., using so called pumping test.\n",

    "## Transmissivity ##\n",
    "\n",
    "When discussing storage properties in {doc}`/contents/flow/lecture_03/13_gw_storage`, we saw that aquifers or single layers may frequently be treated as two-dimensional systems. This is justified because the lateral extension of aquifers is usually much larger than the vertical extension. Thus, vertical variations of storage properties can be replaced by some average value without adversely affecting the quantification of groundwater storage.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similar things can be done with regard to conductivity properties and this brings us to the geohydraulic parameter of transmissivity ($T$,  L$^2$T$^{-1}$). The idea is to neglect vertical variations of hydraulic conductivity and to use vertically averaged values instead. This procedure does not eliminate horizontal variability, so transmissivity may still depend on horizontal coordinates  $(x, y)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The vertically averaged $K$ value is then multiplied by the water-saturated thickness to obtain transmissivity. The concept of water-saturated thickness (or water-saturated depth) requires to distinguish whether _confined_ or _unconfined flow_ conditions prevail.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, water-saturated thickness is the distance from the aquifer bottom to a level up to which all pores are filled with water. For _confined aquifers,_ this level is equal to aquifer top and water-saturated thickness is tantamount to aquifer thickness. For _unconfined aquifers,_ however, water-saturated thickness corresponds to the distance between aquifer bottom and groundwater level. We will see some illustrations below when we try to quantify transmissivity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us have a closer look at the confined case first. The black cuboid in {numref}`Trans_c_2D`  illustrates that water-saturated thickness extends from aquifer bottom to aquifer top. So, it is equal to aquifer thickness $m$. Transmissivity is calculated by $T_x = K_x \\cdot m$ and $T_y = K_y \\cdot m$. Here we allow for horizontal aquifer anisotropy with different hydraulic conductivities in $x-$ and $y-$ direction $(K_x\\neq K_y)$. For horizontally isotropic aquifers $(K_x = K_y = K)$, transmissivity is given by $T = K \\cdot m$.\n",

    "Things are a bit more complicated for unconfined aquifers.  {numref}`Trans_u_2D` illustrates that water-saturated thickness extends from the aquifer bottom to the groundwater table. It is important to note that transmissivity of unconfined aquifers depends on the vertical position of the groundwater table. For instance, if the groundwater table is lowered during to a draught period, transmissivity is decreasing. This is fundamentally different from the confined case where the water-saturated thickness is given by aquifer geometry only and is not affected by hydraulic head changes.\n",
