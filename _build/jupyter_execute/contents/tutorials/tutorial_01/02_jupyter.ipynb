The codes provided in the book, still with only limited skill programming skill, can be adopted for more illustrative use. This can be done in two ways. First approach, and a quick one, will be to use the web-based tool called [Binder Project](https://mybinder.org/). The second approach will be to use the codes in the off-line systems. Common to both approach is very useful computing interface called **JUPYTER**. \n",
