## The Interactive Groundwater-I Book


The site provides an interactive JUPYTER book with contents typical of a _introductory_ groundwater course taught at higher UG level or the early PG level at universities. 

The contents/structure provided here are mostly from those developed and lectured by **Prof. Rudolf Liedl** at [TU Dresden](www.tu-dresden.de). 

The contents are geared towards **learning through computing**. The computing part is entirely based on _Python_ programming language. Previous programming/coding experiences is not required or expected to gain from the provided contents.

The contents of the book are divided into:
1. Lecture Parts
2. Tutorial Parts
3. Self-learning tools

The _lecture_ parts are combination of **texts** and **simpler** numerical examples. Only minimum _Python_ codes are available on this part.
The _tutorial_ are mostly **numerical** examples. This aims at teaching also the basic of Python coding. The focus remains on illustrating lecture contents. _Self-learning tools_ are interactive tools that supports the lecture and tutorial components and enhances understanding. The codes of the tools can require higher knowledge in Python programming. Therefore, codes are hidden.
