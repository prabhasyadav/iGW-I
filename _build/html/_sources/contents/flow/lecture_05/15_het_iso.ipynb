    "\n",
    "The last lecture introduces aquifer properties such hydraulic conductivity, storativity, porosity. The key assumption in that lecture was that the aquifer is an 1D unit, e.g., the Darcy column, and that its properties do not vary in space. In contrast to these, an aquifer is more accurately represented by a 3D system and its properties vary both in space and directions. In fact variations of hydraulic conductivity ($K$), a most critical aquifer quantity, are dominant in most cases. Variations of $K$ can be observed at very small spatial scales and directions. Thus, aquifer properties that depends on $K$ also varies. Consequently, aquifer properties such as $K$ takes a tensor form- a quantity whose magnitude is space and direction dependent. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the picture below ({numref}`aquifer-het`) the 3-D spatial variability of aquifer properties is illustrated by a 2-D vertical cross-section. The picture of the outcrop show some form of a layered system, with each layer likely possessing individual subsurface properties. \n",

    "### Heterogeneity \n",
    "\n",
    "A solid or a porous medium is **homogeneous** if its property do not vary in space. In contrast, the porous medium is **heterogeneous**, or also sometime termed inhomogeneous, if at least one of its properties varies in space. In groundwater studies, heterogeneity or homogeneity is generally associated with hydraulic conductivity $(K)$ of the aquifer. In many practical applications, properties such as strativity and porosity are treated as spatially constant or homogeneous. This is usually done for two reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "- the spatial variability of hydraulic conductivity is much more pronounced than that of storativity and porosity, and\n",
    "- very limited data are available of the spatial variability of storativity and porosity. \n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, an aquifer is:\n",
    "\n",
    "> homogeneous if $K (x, y, z) = K$, and \n",
    "\n",
    "> heterogeneous if $K (x, y, z) \\neq K$\n",
    "\n",
    "For heterogeneous aquifer it is not required that $K$ is varying in all directions, i.e., varying of $K$ can be restricted to one or two spatial coordinates. \n",
    "\n",
    "Heterogeneity in aquifer can exist in many configurations. But they are broadly categorized to the following three classes:\n",
    "\n",
    "> **layered heterogeneity**: common in sedimentary systems and unconsolidated deposits.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **discontinuous heterogeneity**: due to presence of faults, e.g., at the contact between overburden-bedrock.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **trending heterogeneity**: Common in the aquifers with active sedimentation processes\n",
    "\n",
    "Aquifer properties such as storativity and porosity are affected by heterogeneity but they are often considered spatially constant in practical applications. This is because\n",
    "\n",
    "- The spatial variability of hydraulic conductivity is much more pronounced than any other aquifer property, and\n",
    "\n",
    "- Only limited spatial variability data are available for storativity or porosity. \n",

    "## Aquifer Anisotropy\n",
    "\n",
    "A solid or a porous medium is **isotropic** if its (all) properties are independent of _direction._ Conversely, a solid or a porous medium is **anisotropic** if at least one of its property is dependent on direction. Thus, isotropic (or anisotropic) property of porous media refines the concept of homogeneity (or heterogeneity). The key difference being that anisotropy of aquifer is associated only with hydraulic conductivity as other aquifer properties like storativity or porosity cannot depend on direction. Groundwater flow (and more so solute transport) is affected by anisotropy. However, in unconsolidated aquifers the impact of heterogeneity is usually more important.\n",

    "The effective hydraulic conductivity of layered aquifers was shown earlier to depend on the orientation of the flow direction relative to layering, i.e., parallel versus perpendicular. On a larger scale, it may not be possible to identify or resolve heterogeneities associated with example thin layers, small lenses, shape and orientation of grains (see figure above). Nevertheless, $K$ is found to be direction-dependent when groundwater flow is quantified at the larger scale. In these case, small-scale heterogeneity (e.g., due to layering) expresses itself as anisotropy of hydraulic conductivity at the larger scale."

    "used to express that hydraulic conductivity depends on direction. Considering a 3-D Cartesian coordinate system, the directional dependent hydraulic conductivity can be represented by $K_x$, $K_y$ and $K_z$ in parallel with the $x-$, $y-$ and $z-$axis, respectively. Within these, one could distinguish between horizontal conductivities ($K_x$ and $K_y$) with the vertical conductivity $K_z$. More often, anisotropy is observed only between horizontal and vertical directions (i.e., along $x$ or $y$ and $z$ directions), while isotropy is observed along horizontal directions ($x$ and $y$ direction). Thus, symbols $K_h$ representing $K_x = K_y$ and $K_v$ representing $K_z$ can be used to denote horizontal and vertical hydraulic conductivity, respectively. \n",
