    "## Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "The last lecture introduces aquifer properties such hydraulic conductivity, storativity, porosity. The key assumption in that lecture was that the aquifer is an 1D unit, e.g., the Darcy column, and that its properties do not vary in space. In contrast to these, an aquifer is more accurately represented by a 3D system and its properties vary both in space and directions. In fact variations of hydraulic conductivity ($K$), a most critical aquifer quantity, are dominant in most cases. Variations of $K$ can be observed at very small spatial scales and directions. Thus, aquifer properties that depends on $K$ also varies. Consequently, aquifer properties such as $K$ takes a tensor form- a quantity whose magnitude is space and direction dependent. \n",
    "\n",
    "The picture below the 3-D spatial variability of aquifer properties is illustrated by a 2-D vertical cross-section. The picture of the outcrop show some form of a layered system, with each layer likely possessing individual subsurface properties. \n",

    "## Heterogeneity \n",
    "\n",
    "A solid or a porous medium is **homogeneous** if its property do not vary in space. In contrast, the porous medium is **heterogeneous**, or also sometime termed inhomogeneous, if at least one of its properties varies in space. In groundwater studies, heterogeneity or homogeneity is generally associated with hydraulic conductivity $(K)$ of the aquifer. In many practical applications, properties such as strativity and porosity are treated as spatially constant or homogeneous. This is usually done for two reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "- the spatial variability of hydraulic conductivity is much more pronounced than that of storativity and porosity, and\n",
    "- very limited data are available of the spatial variability of storativity and porosity. \n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, an aquifer is:\n",
    "\n",
    "> homogeneous if $K (x, y, z) = K$, and \n",
    "\n",
    "> heterogeneous if $K (x, y, z) \\neq K$\n",
    "\n",
    "For heterogeneous aquifer it is not required that $K$ is varying in all directions, i.e., varying of $K$ can be restricted to one or two spatial coordinates. \n",
    "\n",
    "Heterogeneity in aquifer can exist in many configurations. But they are broadly categorized to the following three classes:\n",
    "\n",
    "> **layered heterogeneity**: common in sedimentary systems and unconsolidated deposits.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **discontinuous heterogeneity**: due to presence of faults, e.g., at the contact between overburden-bedrock.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **trending heterogeneity**: Common in the aquifers with active sedimentation processes\n",
    "\n",
    "Aquifer properties such as storativity and porosity are affected by heterogeneity but they are often considered spatially constant in practical applications. This is because\n",
    "\n",
    "- The spatial variability of hydraulic conductivity is much more pronounced than any other aquifer property, and\n",
    "\n",
    "- Only limited spatial variability data are available for storativity or porosity. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Heterogeneity play a significant role in controlling the flow of groundwater, but its quantification is more relevant to the transport of chemicals in groundwater. "
