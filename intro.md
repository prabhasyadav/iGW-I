## The `Interactive` Groundwater-I Book


The site provides an interactive JUPYTER-notebook based book with contents typical of an _introductory_ groundwater course taught at higher UG level or the early PG level at universities. 

The contents/structure provided here are mostly from those developed and lectured by **Prof. Rudolf Liedl** at [TU Dresden](https://tu-dresden.de/). 

The contents are geared towards **learning through computing**. The computing part is entirely based on `Python` programming language. Previous programming/coding experiences are not required or expected. Coding is to be learned as a _method of learning_ and is considered as a skill enhancing component rather than knowledge acquiring component, which is focussed towards **Groundwater** learning.

The contents of the book are divided into:
1. Lecture Parts
2. Tutorial Parts
3. Self-learning (simulation) tools

The _lecture_ parts are combination of **texts** and **simpler** numerical examples. Only minimum `Python` codes are available on this part.
The _tutorial_ are mostly **numerical** examples. This aims at teaching also the basic of `Python` coding. The focus remains on illustrating lecture contents. _Self-learning tools_ are interactive tools that supports the lecture and tutorial components and enhances understanding. The codes of these _tools_ may require higher knowledge of `Python` programming and therefore they are not to be mastered as part of the course.
