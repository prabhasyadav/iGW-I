    "In the figure, the chemicals (contaminants) first enters the _vadose zone_, an unstatured part of the subsurface from the ground surface. The entry is faciliated with phenomenan such as rainfall. As only limited water are available and there are almost no continuous horizontal flow, the contaminants, mostly as a pure phase,  in this zone often travels vertically until it reaches the groundwater table - a boundary between an unstaturated and saturated subsurface. Beneath the water-table, the contaminants mixes with the flowing groundwater and spreads both vertically and horizontally along the saturated zone resulting to a development of a contaminant plume."
