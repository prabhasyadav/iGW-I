    "In the previous lectures we attempted to understand and quantify the different sub-surface properties, e.g., hydraulic head, conductivity, and attempted to characterize them in space (homogeneous versus heterogeneous) and direction (isotropic versus anisotropic). Finally, introducing the Darcy's law in all dimensions.\n",
