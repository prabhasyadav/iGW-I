    "\n",
    "The Darcy's column experiment is associated with one-dimensional (1D) steady-state or time independent flow system. In addition, the experiments as we discussed in lecture 4, dealt with homogeneous (space dependency) and isotropic (direction dependency)  porous media. The consequence of these is that the hydraulic head $h$ in a Darcy column therefore depends on a single space coordinate, say $x$ that is oriented along the column length. Therefore $h = h(x)$ in this case.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now considering the real/natural aquifer, which is inherently three dimensional (3D), the hydraulic head is then a function of three space coordinates, i.e., $h = h(x,y,z)$. But the 3D natural problem can be simplified to 2D problems based on the fact that vertical flow components (e.g., the aquifer depth) is very much smaller than horizontal flow components (the aquifer width or its length), i.e., $h = h(x,y)$ considering $z$ as vertical components. The 2D approach, instead of 3D, has been found to appropriately quantify groundwater flow systems. The application of 2D or 1D for quantifying in groundwater flow system have be justified for each case.  For example the layered aquifers, that was discussed in lecture 5, can be easily treated as a 2D system. \n",

    "We make a slight detour from the Darcy's law and quantifying groundwater flow system to **visualizing** the groundwater flow. As can be expected, visualizing groundwater is a challenging task. This is largely because sub-surface, compared to surface, cannot be mapped with very high resolution. However, it is possible to connect aquifer properties such as $h$ hydraulic head to visualize groundwater flow system. Particularly used to visualize groundwater are:\n",

    "> **Isolines**: The curves (in 2D space) where a physical quantity (e.g., $h$) assumes a certain value. Isolines are thus suitable for visualizing 2D problems.\n",
