    "This lecture introduces the realm of mathematical modeling realm in groundwater studies. In the previous lectures the fundamental quantities, their properties and approach to quantify them were discussed. Those information were then used to develop system equations for varieties of groundwater problems. It was discussed then that these system equations require mathematical approaches the theory for which have to be systematically discussed and understood. Groundwater modeling can then be described as the systematic use of mathematical approaches leading to solution of the groundwater problem.\n",

    "Very succinctly a  **model** is a representation, which may be an image or a description of a real system. The description can be of different form (e.g., scales), of different level of detail (e.g., conceptual versus mathematical). The **system** to be modeled can be a **real** or also **conceptual**. A very relevant example of a real system for this course is the Darcy's experiment (see figure below), in which water is made  to flow through the porous media.\n",

    "With Darcy's experiment, one could set-up a mathematical model to relate flow rate and hydraulic gradient ($h$). As model is _only an image_ of the real system, several assumptions have to be made in it's development. At many instances the model can not be set without these assumptions. In other cases solution of the model may not be possible without these assumptions being part of the model development. Darcyâ€˜s Law, for instance, does not provide an exact representation of flow through individual pore channels. Rather, **average** flow behaviour through **many** pore channels is represented.\n",
